# Using & Making Keymaps

Many apps and games already have full keymaps available on the Discord. For more info see [this article](./import_export_keymaps.md). Additionally, you can  find them on the [keymaps repository](https://github.com/PlayCover/keymaps). 

## Using Keymapping

Once you've finished importing or creating your keymap, you can toggle it on or off using the `option ⌥` key.

## Creating & Editing Keymapping

You can open and close the Keymapping Editor at any time with:
* `command ⌘` + `K`
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Open/Close Keymapping Editor

Once in the Keymapping Editor you can add a new button by clicking on the screen. A ring menu will appear around the cursor with several different button types.

The following table will describe each button and what they do.

| Symbol | Button | Usage |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | ------------- |

Useful for pressing buttons on the UI. By default this will create a single button mapped to `LMB` (Left Mouse Button). |
