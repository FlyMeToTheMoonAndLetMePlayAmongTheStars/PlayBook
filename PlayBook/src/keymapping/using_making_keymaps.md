# Using & Making Keymaps

Many apps and games already have full keymaps available on the Discord. For more info see [this article](./import_export_keymaps.md). Additionally, you can  find them on the [keymaps repository](https://github.com/PlayCover/keymaps). 

## Using Keymapping

Once you've finished importing or creating your keymap, you can toggle it on or off using the `option ⌥` key.

## Creating & Editing Keymapping

You can **open** and **close** the Keymapping Editor while in app with:
* `command ⌘` + `K`
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Open/Close Keymapping Editor

Once in the Keymapping Editor you can add a new button by clicking on the screen. A ring menu will appear around the cursor with different button types. Closing the editor will automatically save any changes you made to the keymap.

The following table will describe each button and how they work.

| Symbol | Button | Usage |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | ------------- |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210868935-5f04fbbd-48a8-4b99-ba1f-b40c541fad95.png">  | Circle | Adds a single key binding. Useful for pressing buttons on the UI. By default this will create a single button mapped to `LMB` (Left Mouse Button). |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210870935-25a6b669-97f2-493e-b607-40304d7fa027.png"> | Directional Pad | Adds 8-way directional joystick, where Up, Down, Left, and Right are bound to keys (by default mapped to `W` `A` `S` `D`). Useful for movement joysticks. |

Useful for camera control. Can be mapped to other keys to recreate draggable touchscreen aiming controls present in some games. |

Useful for games that require 360-degree movement control instead of 8-way directional movement. |

> The key bound to each button can be changed by clicking the keymap to select it and pressing the key you want to bind it to. Button position can be changed by selecting the button and dragging it to your desired position.

You can **delete** a selected button with:
* `command ⌘` + `delete`
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Delete selected element

You can **increase** a selected button's size with:
* `command ⌘` + `▲`
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Upsize selected element 

You can **decrease** a selected button's size with:
