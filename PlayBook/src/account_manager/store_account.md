# Store Account

>__Note__: Currently, this feature only works for Genshin Impact.

You can store multiple accounts to easily switch between them later, this allows you to bypass the inconvenient login process of disabling and re-enabling SIP.

To store an account, right click on Genshin Impact, then click on `Store Account`.
