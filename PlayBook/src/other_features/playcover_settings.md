## Uninstall 
You can customize the default app uninstall behavior by defining which files or directories should be deleted alongside the app.

`Clear data` will clear the following directories:
```
~/Library/Application Scripts/<com.bundle.id>
~/Library/Caches/<com.bundle.id>
~/Library/Containers/<com.bundle.id>
~/Library/HTTPStorages/<com.bundle.id>
```
`Remove keymap`, `Remove settings` and `Remove entitlements` clear the following directories respectively:
```
```

There is also a prune function, which will clear all data from previously installed apps that have since been uninstalled.
