# Account Manager

Account Manager lets you store the login details of an account so you can effortlessly switch between different accounts without the need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) every time. **Currently, this feature only works for Genshin Impact.**

## Store Account

You can store multiple accounts to easily switch between them later, this allows you to bypass the inconvenient login process of disabling, modifying boot-args, and re-enabling SIP.

To store an account, right click on Genshin Impact, then click on `Store Account`.

You can restore an account by clicking on its name, doing so will replace the previous account that you used to sign in. If you have not stored the previous account, you will not be able to easily switch back to it afterwards, and will have to disable SIP and modify boot-args again in order to login to that account.
